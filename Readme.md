An improved version of the hangman game where instead of asking the user for the secret word, the game radomly selects a word that is longer than 3 letters from a text file.
Uses mersenne_twister_engine (https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/numeric/random/mersenne_twister_engine) to genarate a random number and select a word from the text.
